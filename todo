use username on connection
add password to be used with username
on server create path for each username change code to use username path
remove newlines from errors and connection methods
encrypt vaults with client created key and password
each vault should have clear text header with iud, creation date and encryption data

steps for adding password
impliment with plain-text first, add encryption later
"database" of users
if user exists then check password stored
if user doesn't exist need to create user
database of users should only be pulled from server, not created locally
when creating user, should be created on server then synced locally

on startup try to connect to server
if successful pull updated user databse
if unsuccessful allow user to login with local synced database

when logging in get username if exists in database continue with login
if doesn't exist in database say no user
give option to create user
try to connect to server
if connection successful continue with user creation
if not successful inform connection issue and to try again later
eventually user gets approved through email if option is selected to allow that.

impliment user database sqlite?
in user database should track first name, last name, username, password, creation data, password update date
