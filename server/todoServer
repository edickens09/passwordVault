need to sink username verify it exists in a database and then do a check for that users vault folder
Should the database for users be SQL?
Client needs to send the username to the server. When should this happen?
Does username need to be sent as a string or should it be sent as bytes?
Should server be the system that registers a user or should it be the client and then synced to the server
